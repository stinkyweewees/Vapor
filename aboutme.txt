    <h1>Why is the internet so important</h1>

    <p>Im just a 13 year old boy that doesn't know much. But I kinda like to think about things. Like the internet, its almost magical.Thanks to the trans-ocean-data cables  can I talk to anyone  all around the world in real time.</p>
   
<p> For me thats magical, or well, hard to understand. But in the end are we are just apes with smartphones on a fragile tiny island in space
looking into the sky and wondering how the universe works.</p>

<p> here are some links why the internet is the solution to most of our problems</p>

  </ul>
  
  <p> The internet is one gigantic well-stocked fridge ready for raiding; for some strange reason, people go up there and just give stuff away.
